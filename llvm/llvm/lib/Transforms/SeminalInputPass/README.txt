How to run code:Compile test case:clang -O0 -g3 -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -disable-O0-optnone -fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types <Test name>.c -S -emit-llvm -o <Test name>.llcompile code:clang++ -shared -fPIC -o libSeminalInputPass.so SeminalInputPass.cpp $(llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core)run code:opt -load-pass-plugin=./libSeminalInputPass.so -passes="seminal-input-pass" -disable-output <Test name>.llInterpretation of test results:Test.c:The n variable, read via scanf, is crucial as it determines the number of iterations for the loop. This directly impacts the value of the calculated sum and the program's output. The dependency on n highlights its role as a key input feature. The line outputted is when n is assigned a value which is in line 6. The key point outputted is the actual loop which uses the seminal input.Test2.c:The fp variable (a file pointer) is identified as the key input feature since the program's behavior relies on data read from the file. This highlights that file-based inputs are tracked as seminal input features. The line outputted is where fp is being used to give input to c.Test3.c:The choice variable is crucial as it drives the program flow by determining the user's selected operation. The line outputted is where choice is assigned a value.The loc variable is another key input as it specifies the position for insertion or deletion in the linked list, impacting the linked list's structure. The two lines outputted is where the loc variable is assigned a value in the two functions.Test4.cThe readLine function relies on line (a dynamically allocated buffer) and fp.addr (a file pointer). This shows that it processes external inputs, likely reading data line-by-line from a file. The line variable determines weather readLine continues execution and the length of fp determines run time of while loop.The readParks function has numerous dependencies on line and catalog.addr, indicating its role in populating and managing the Catalog data structure from file inputs. Both line and catalog.addr determine run time of readParks.Test5.cThe main function's dependency on ch (line 186) reflects its role in handling user input to select linked list operations from a menu. The repeated dependencies on ch highlight its importance in the program's decision-making.Other functions do not have direct input dependencies, as they operate on the linked list's internal state or rely on parameters passed by the main function. Test.c was straight from the docs project description, test2.c was modified from the docs project description. Test 3.c was from https://gist.github.com/mycodeschool/7429492 . Test4.c was from a project in one of my previous courses. Test5.c was from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/asn1parse.c . My clang and llvm-config version was 19.1.4.How to get updated clang version on VCL:sudo apt-get install -y wget gpgwget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.shchmod +x llvm.shsudo ./llvm.sh 19export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-19/bin:$PATHsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install libstdc++-12-dev
